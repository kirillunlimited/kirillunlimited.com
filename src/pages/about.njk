about:
  - Hello, my name is Kirill. I am a frontend engineer based in Berlin.
  - I always loved designing and building things, so I suppose it is natural that I became an engineer. At university I was into different technologies, such as game dev, 3D modeling and computer linguistics.
  - But it was the web that I really fell in love with...
  - I have been building stuff on the web since 2015. Throughout my career, I grew up from a HTML-developer to a full-fledged front-end engineer. I have experience using different programming languages, but my core skill is based on JavaScript, so I enjoy doing most of the things using JavaScript. I have been lucky enough to be involved in building and maintaining a bunch of solid and complex projects that allowed me to gain a lot of professional experience.
  - What excites me most about working in software development is being able to craft things that have purpose and solve real problems. I enjoy building valuable, engaging and performant products with intuitive and dynamic user experience. In other words, my passion is to build products I would like to use myself.
  - I am currently trying to focus on further development in the technical field of building web products. Maybe someday I will try my hand at management, but solving technical problems still gives me enough satisfaction to keep going.
