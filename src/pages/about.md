      Hello, my name is Kirill. I'm a 31 year old front-end developer from Moscow trying to settle down in Berlin.
      I've been building stuff on the web for the last 7 years. My core skill is based on JavaScript and I love to do most of the things using JavaScript. I have experience of building and maintaining different large complex front-end projects.

      I enjoy creating useful, engaging and performant products with intuitive and dynamic user experience. I always keep learning new technologies, tools and development approaches to achieve better quaility of my work. I like to be a part of a team, collaborate with talented developers and share my experience with others.
