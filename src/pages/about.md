    <p>Hello, my name is Kirill. I'm a front-end developer in my early 30s. I'm from Moscow, but currently I'm trying to settle down in Berlin.</p>
    <p>
      I've been building stuff on the web for the last 7 years. My core skill is based on JavaScript, so I enjoy doing most of the things using JavaScript. I’ve been lucky enough to be involved in building and maintaining a bunch of solid and complex front-end projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      What excites me most about working in software development is being able to craft things that have purpose and solve real problems. I enjoy building useful, engaging and performant products with intuitive and dynamic user experience.
    </p>
    <p>I'm not afraid of challenges, as this is the main thing that helps me to grow as a developer. I always keep learning new technologies, tools and development approaches to come up with better solutions in my work.
    </p>
    <p>I'm a team player, so I like to collaborate with talented and passionated developers and share my experience with others.</p>
    <p>You can find more info about my skills and experience on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kirillunlimited" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
