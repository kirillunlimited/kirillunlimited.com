Currently I develop web-interfaces at [Ozon](https://www.ozon.ru){target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. You can find more information about my experience and skills on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kirillunlimited){target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, but I do not consider any job&nbsp;offers.

I spend most of my free time with my family. The rest of the time I enjoy watching movies, listening to music, reading books, playing computer and board games, writing code for fun, travelling and trying myself in different sports.
