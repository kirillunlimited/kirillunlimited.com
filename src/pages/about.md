Hello, my name is Kirill. I am a front-end engineer in my early 30s. I am from Moscow, but currently I am trying to settle down in Berlin.

I always loved designing and building things, so I suppose it is natural that I became an engineer. At university I was into different technologies, such as game dev, 3D modeling and computer linguistics, but web development fascinated me the most.

I have been building stuff on the web since 2015. Throughout my career, I grew up from a HTML-developer to a full-fledged front-end engineer. I have experience using different programming languages, but my core skill is based on JavaScript, so I enjoy doing most of the things using JavaScript. I have been lucky enough to be involved in building and maintaining a bunch of solid and complex projects that allowed me to gain a lot of professional experience.

What excites me most about working in software development is being able to craft things that have purpose and solve real problems. I enjoy building valuable, engaging and performant products with intuitive and dynamic user experience.

I am not afraid of challenges, as this is the main thing that helps me to grow as a developer. I am a quick learner, and my curiosity helps me with that. I always keep learning new technologies, tools and development approaches to come up with better solutions in my work.

Although, I am comfortable working on my own, I also gain a lot of pleasure from being a team player, as I like to collaborate with talented and passionate developers and share my experience with others.

I am open for hire. You can find more information about my skills and experience on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kirillunlimited){target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. Feel free to reach out to me with any [contact method](/contact/) you prefer.
