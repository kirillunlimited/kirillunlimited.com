Hello, my name is Kirill. I am a front-end developer in my early 30s. I am from Moscow, but currently I am trying to settle down in Berlin.

I have been building stuff on the web since 2015. My core skill is based on JavaScript, so I enjoy doing most of the things using JavaScript. I have been lucky enough to be involved in building and maintaining a bunch of solid and complex front-end projects that allowed me to gain a lot of professional experience.

What excites me most about working in software development is being able to craft things that have purpose and solve real problems. I enjoy building useful, engaging and performant products with intuitive and dynamic user experience.

I am not afraid of challenges, as this is the main thing that helps me to grow as a developer. I always keep learning new technologies, tools and development approaches to come up with better solutions in my work.

Although, I am comfortable working on my own, I also gain a lot of satisfaction from being a team player, as I like to collaborate with talented and passionated developers and share my experience with others.

Also, I am open for hire. You can find more information about my skills and experience on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kirillunlimited" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>. Feel free to reach out to me with any [contact method](/contact/) you prefer.
