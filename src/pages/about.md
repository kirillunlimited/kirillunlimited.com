    <p>Hello, my name is Kirill. I'm a 31-year-old front-end developer from Moscow. Currently I'm trying to settle down in Berlin.</p>
    <p>
      I've been building stuff on the web for the last 7 years. My core skill is based on JavaScript, so I enjoy doing most of the things using JavaScript. I’ve been lucky enough to be involved in building and maintaining solid and complex front-end projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      What excites me most about working in software development is being able to craft things that have purpose and solve real problems. I enjoy building useful, engaging and performant products with intuitive and dynamic user experience.
    </p>
    <p>I'm not afraid of challenges, as this is the main thing that helps me to grow as a developer. I always keep learning new technologies, tools and development approaches to come up with better solutions in my work.
    </p>
    <p>I'm a team player, so I like to collaborate with talented and passionated developers and share my experience with others.</p>
