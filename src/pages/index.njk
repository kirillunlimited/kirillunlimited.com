title: Kirill Ivanov
description: Hello, my name is Kirill Ivanov. I am a software engineer.
script: 'about.js'

about:
  background: I always loved creating things and was curious about how things worked, so I suppose it is natural that I became an engineer. At university I was into different technologies, such as game dev, 3D modeling and computer linguistics. But it was the web that I really fell in love with...
  experience: Throughout my career, I was involved in building and maintaining a bunch of solid and complex high-load projects with a lot of interfactivity. The most significant projects I have been involved in are&#58; <a href="https://cityads.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CPA marketing platform</a>, <a href="https://art3d.ru/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">corporate and promo sites for construction companies</a> and <a href="https://www.ozon.ru/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the biggest marketplaces in Russia</a> with <a href="https://seller.ozon.ru/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">admin panel for sellers</a>.
  motivation: What excites me most about working in software development is being able to craft things that have purpose and solve real problems. I enjoy building valuable, engaging and performant products that provide intuitive and dynamic user experience. In other words, my passion is to build products I would like to use myself.
