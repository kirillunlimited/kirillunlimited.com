Just a decade ago, web development was straightforward: all rendering was done server-side, meaning each click on a hyperlink loaded a new page with fully-rendered HTML. This thin client setup allowed browsers to seamlessly handle navigation and made the system ideally suited for search engine indexing.

## Era of SPA

As the internet evolved, so did user expectations. Websites were no longer just static pages of information, but needed to be interactive with features such as real-time updates and dynamic content. This demand led to the creation of Single Page Applications (SPA), where the backend transformed into an API serving data, and the frontend handled rendering and interactions.

In mid-2000s Gmail revolutionized web development by becoming the first true SPA project. Its seamless user experience inspired developers worldwide to adopt this new model, leading to the creation of frameworks like [React](https://react.dev/){target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, [Angular](https://angular.dev/){target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/){target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. SPAs became the go-to solution for many applications, which required real-time interactions and a fluid user experience.

## SPA Challenges

Despite their advantages, SPAs presented several challenges. The client-side rendering model conflicted with traditional web conventions, leading to complications with browser navigation and SEO indexing. Developers had to manage navigation history manually, and static URLs became a problem for link sharing. Additionally, the increase in network interactions led to more errors, requiring robust error-handling mechanisms.

One of the promises of SPAs was faster performance, as only raw data needed to be loaded, with the client handling the rest. However, advancements in HTTP protocols, browser capabilities, and caching soon diminished this advantage. Issues with waiting times and the overuse of loading spinners created a perception of constant loading, affecting the user experience.

SPAs also necessitated the duplication of backend logic on the frontend. Validation, business rules, and functionalities had to be replicated, effectively doubling the developersâ€™ workload. This duplication led to increased complexity and slower development speeds, highlighting the need for a more efficient approach.

## Returning to Server-Side Rendering

As the limitations of SPAs became more apparent, the frontend community began to revisit SSR as a viable and often superior alternative.

The popularisation of SSR among frontend developers can be largely attributed to the widespread adoption of frameworks with server-side rendering. These frameworks provide an elegant integration of SSR with modern JavaScript libraries and frameworks like React and Vue.js. [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/){target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, for instance, has become a de facto choice for many React developers seeking to leverage SSR's benefits without sacrificing the advantages of a component-based architecture. By abstracting much of the complexity involved in SSR, these frameworks have made it accessible and practical for everyday use in web development.

One of the key factors driving the shift towards SSR is the improvement in initial load times and the overall user experience. With SPAs, the client must download and execute a large JavaScript bundle before any meaningful content can be displayed, leading to longer wait times. In contrast, SSR provides fully rendered HTML from the server, allowing users to see and interact with content almost immediately. This not only enhances the user experience but also plays a crucial role in performance metrics that impact search engine rankings and user retention.

The SEO benefits of SSR have also played a significant role in its resurgence. Search engine optimization is a critical aspect of web development, as higher visibility in search engine results can drive more traffic to a website. SPAs often struggle with SEO because search engine bots can have difficulty indexing dynamically generated content. SSR addresses this issue by serving pre-rendered HTML that search engines can easily crawl and index, leading to better search performance and higher organic traffic.

## SSR Pitfalls

While SSR addresses many of the shortcomings of SPAs, it also introduces its own set of challenges. One of the primary issues is the increased server load. Because each user request requires the server to render the HTML before sending it to the client, SSR can be more resource-intensive, especially for high-traffic applications. This necessitates careful consideration of server scalability and performance optimization to handle increased demands effectively.

Unlike SPAs, which can provide a highly interactive experience from the start, SSR pages may be less interactive until the client-side JavaScript takes over. This can lead to a temporary lag in interactivity, known as the "re-hydration" phase, where the client-side JavaScript enhances the static HTML with interactive features.

Also, managing application state can be more complex in SSR, as developers need to ensure that state is properly synchronized between the server and client. This can involve additional code to hydrate the client-side application with the server-rendered state, adding complexity to the development process.

Finally, SSR development can be more challenging to debug and develop compared to SPAs. The need to manage code that runs on both the server and the client can introduce additional complexity, requiring a deeper understanding of both environments.

## The Rise of Hybrid Frameworks

Developers began to explore a hybrid approach that combined the best of both worlds. This approach involved returning to classic server-side HTML generation using backend frameworks, supplemented by data attributes and minimal JavaScript.

At the forefront of this hybrid model stands [htmx](https://htmx.org/){target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, a pioneering framework that champions a simplified approach to dynamic web development. By leveraging data attributes, htmx grants developers the ability to control client-side interactions directly from the HTML markup. This means that the primary focus shifts back to generating valid HTML on the server, while htmx seamlessly inserts and updates this content within the DOM as needed. Consequently, developers can maintain a clean and straightforward server-side codebase while still delivering interactive and responsive user experiences on the client side.

Taking the hybrid approach a step further, [Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/){target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} enriches the server-rendered content with dynamic interactions that transcend the capabilities of traditional SSR alone. By introducing behavior-driven development, Stimulus empowers developers to augment existing HTML components with minimal JavaScript code. This enables the creation of rich, interactive interfaces without sacrificing the benefits of server-side rendering.

Additionally, the [Qwik](https://qwik.dev/){target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} framework has entered the scene, offering an innovative solution to the hybrid model. Qwik is designed to deliver instant loading web applications by using a resumable architecture, which allows web applications to start up with minimal JavaScript. It achieves this by splitting the application code into small, lazy-loaded chunks that only activate when needed, thus optimizing both the performance and user experience.

Essentially, these frameworks signal a beginning of a new era in web development. They leverage the advancements in web technologies to offer a more balanced approach, integrating both client and server-side rendering. This hybrid model promises to address the challenges posed by SPAs while retaining the benefits of interactive and dynamic web applications.

## Future of Web Development

The evolution of web development reflects the ongoing quest for balance and efficiency. From the simplicity of server-side rendering to the interactivity of SPAs, and now to the promising hybrid models, each phase has brought valuable lessons. As the industry continues to evolve, hybrid approach is likely to become the standard, providing the best of both server-side and client-side rendering.
